=head0 Introducing Plack

Plack is superglue for the modern Perl web.

Glue is easy. With enough glue you can stick almost anything together. It
doesn't have to be art. You just have to smear enough adhesive on two surfaces
and smash them together long enough for them to dry.

In that sense, Plack is I<better> than superglue. Plack is a toolkit for web
developers. Plack provides a series of interfaces for web developers. Plack
offers a standard way for doing the very common (and a few uncommon) things
that every web application does.

When you use Plack, you write less code. You have more options. You take
advantage of new possibilities. You spend your time and resources doing what's
important to your application--not doing the same thing over and over again,
but creating new things.

Plack is superglue, yes. More than that, it's a way of arranging your code to
take advantage of how the web really works. You're probably only minutes away
from being able to use it.
