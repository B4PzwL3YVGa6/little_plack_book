=head0 Deploying a Plack Application

In the olden days of CGI programming, deploying a web application meant
understanding the details of file layout, configuration files, directory
permissions, and even how the web server communicated with your application or
app server. PSGI and Plack reduce that deployment burden to a few decisions:
what server to use and how to customize the application's environment.

Plack's backend server adaptors do much of the work, but Plack's frontend
system--in the form of the C<plackup> program and the F<.psgi> file
convention--simplifies the common and tedious details and allows configuration
where you really want it.
