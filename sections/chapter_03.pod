=head0 Testing Plack Applications

The Perl community as a whole trusts that its software works because of a
relentless focus on automated testing. If you've installed distributions from
the CPAN, you've seen that the best code tends to have plenty of tests which
run before installation. The same tools and techniques used to test modules and
distributions are available to test applications. Perl and the CPAN make that
easy.

True to form, Plack and PSGI make testing your applications easy, too. Because
you can deploy any well-written Plack application to any conforming Plack
backend, you don't have to spend your development time configuring and
deploying an application to run fragile tests against it. Your tests can have
full control over the testing environment of your application--with or without
even running a web server locally--thanks to C<Plack::Test>.
